title: What is ESExplain?
permalink: /

ESExplain is a website containing articles about the features coming to the JavaScript (ECMAScript) language.

## How is this different from other resources out there?

Sometimes learning resources (books, videos, articles) aren't very accessible in their explanations.
I ([@charlotteis][@charlotteis]) don't find `foo` `bar` `baz` examples very helpful to my learning.

There are so many ways we can illustrate programming concepts that are more interesting that using a `Car` to explain Object Oriented Programming. Check out this [awesome video][good parts] from [@brnnbrn][@brnnbrn] on making JavaScript learning ~fun~.

ESExplain attempts to make ES2015 onwards an approachable set of concepts, with simple language, emoji and a sprinkling of cake references.

Check out the list of articles and start to learn some cool new JavaScripts!

{% highlight javascript %}
function welcome(name) {
    return `Hi ${name}, and welcome to ESExplain!`
}

console.log(welcome('friend'))
// -> 'Hi friend, and welcome to ESExplain!'
{% endhighlight %}
