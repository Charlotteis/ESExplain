# ExplainingES2015


## Documentation Driven Development

We're going to make a static site with fun & friendly ES2015 examples. Too often do we see examples that `foo` and `bar` and `i` and `k`.
No longer shall we explain Object Oriented Program with the use of Cars!

I imagine a static two-column website with 'the old way' displayed alongisde the 'new way'. With an explanation at the top.
Bonus points for being able to run them in the web page, but embedded JSBin snippets is probably the most friendly way of doing this!

Let's try deploying to Surge (never used it, could be fun!) every time the repo is updated (is that even possible?).

### How is this different from other tutorials?

Maybe it isn't! But my hope is that these will be easier to understand than some of the stuff that is being written right now.
