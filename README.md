## What is this?

ESExplain is a website containing articles about the features coming to the JavaScript (ECMAScript) language.

## How is this different from other resources out there?

Sometimes learning resources (books, videos, articles) aren't very accessible in their explanations.
I ([@charlotteis][@charlotteis]) don't find `foo` `bar` `baz` examples very helpful to my learning :no_good:.

There are so many ways we can illustrate programming concepts that are more interesting than using a `Car` to explain Object Oriented Programming. Check out this [awesome video][good parts] from [@brnnbrn][@brnnbrn] on making JavaScript learning ~fun~.

ESExplain attempts to make ES2015 onwards an approachable set of concepts, with simple language, emoji and a sprinkling of cake references.

## N I C E, how do I get involved?
