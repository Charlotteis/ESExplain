## I've found a bug!

It'd be much appreciated if you could fill out an [issue][issue]. Adding as much detail as you can, including screenshots if needed.

Feel free to send a Pull Request fixing it! For minor fixes like word mispellings, you can edit the page directly from GitHub and
GitHub will help you make a Pull Request. You can even add whole files from the browser, writing an entire article without having to use
the command line.

## I'd like to write a post!

Awesome. Please submit a [post proposal][post proposal], explaining what you'd like to write about.

An article for ESExplain should contain the following:
- A friendly explanation of what the new feature is
- If it's replacing an older JavaScript feature (e.g. how `let` and `const` can replace `var`) then talk briefly about how the old way
of doing things was, including code snippets.
- Code snippets, showing how the new feature works
- Links to a [JSBin][JSBin] of the code examples, so people can try them out in the browser.

There's no need to have an article written before you propose it, I just wanted to give you an idea of what it should look like.
